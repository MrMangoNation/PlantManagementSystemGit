Plants system

Mock up:

Plant box:
Name of plant/crop/herb
Location
Date planted
Aprox. Date for harvest
Special notes


There’ll be 2 different CSV files
1 which functions as a database that contains the data for all the plants and cultivars
The second one will be used to keep track of the planted plants, when they’ve been planted and where


PlantClass:
This class will only be used to store data about a plant, such as its species, its best planting month etc.
This is more akin to a database, but done in CSV cuz I don’t know how to work with a database
- Plant name
    - Type of plant/cultivar
- Best month to plant
- Time it takes to sprout
- Time it takes to grow/harvest from point of planting
- Additional remarks that might be useful to know


Using the CSV file to save, modify and move data between sessions
What data do we want stored in the CSV file?
- Plant (plantName)
    - Type of plant/cultivar (optional)
- Date planted
    - From the date planted, also generate when approximately the plant would be ready for harvest
        - This can be done with the tkinter calendar package
        - Have to figure out a way to work with dates
- Location planted
- Through the systemn allow for projected growth time, and harvest time from the database file
Once we have this data, we need to write it to the CSV file
One way to do this is with pandas and a DataFrame
Load the CSV as a pandas dataframe, edit it and afterwards save it back to the CSV
Later we can read from this CSV to display which plants are planted where
Find a way to allow the user to set a predetermined size of the plant box/hydroponics system




Next steps:
- Data preservation between sessions
    - Come up with a way to save the currently planted plants, and be able to load and read from this file and modify it.
    - Currently the plan is to use a CSV to save and edit the currently planted plants.
        - Use a tk window to display the plants form the CSV file
        - Find a way to edit the CSV with an entry window for the plants
        - Could load the CSV with pandas, change the data frame and then write the data frame back to the CSV
- Plant list with information about plants herbs and other things that I can plant.
    - This can be done with a database maybe, since it does not need a lot of modifaction

For plant frame
- Can use a list with all the plant names, using a CSV file
Create the frames before the function, with a while loop, stopping when the last plant has been hit
Then create the labels for the plant with a function and a for loop, printing each property of the class to the frame
