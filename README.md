This program is made for maintaining and planning for plants
It is mostly built for myself in combination for a hydroponics system


There are 2 layers to this program:
- Database for plants that can be editted
- GUI which tracks plant growth, and where growth can be logged
Database:
- Contains general information of the plant, such as projected growth time, harvest time and additional remarks to keep track of
- Can be edited easily, to add or remove plants or cultivars
- The database is used in the GUI of the program as well to help the user plan their planting

GUI:
- The main part of the program which shows all the information for the user regarding planted plants, information about the plants, projected growth and harvesting times
- This will exist out of several windows using Tkinter allowing the user to add plants, remove plants, have the planted plants show in a nice overview
- The main objective is to allow the user to easily change plants, and show a nice overview of what is planted
